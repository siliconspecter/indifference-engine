# Main Page

The goal of this project is to provide an engine for small-scale retro-styled
games of approximately fifth-generation console fidelity, which will be as easy
to build and run in fifty years' time as now.  To achieve this:

- All file formats, programming languages and other tools used are the amongst
  the simplest, longest-established and widely supported.
- Third-party dependencies are kept to a minimum, both at build and run time.
- Full but minimalistic platform abstraction, preferring portability over
  platform-provided features or performance.

A game built upon Indifference Engine is split into two components which are
packaged together:

- An entirely self-contained WASM module containing all logic and data needed to
  run the game to completion, which is identical across all platforms.  Details
  can be found [here](./wasm_module/index.md).
- A platform-specific runtime which hosts the WASM module. TODO link

For details regarding the protocol between the two components, please
