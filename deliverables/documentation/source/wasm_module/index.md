It is recommended to first get the WASM module to build, instructions for which
can be found [here](./building.md).

A guide to using the engine to build games can be found in the
[engine overview](./engine_overview.md).

The engine is built to a set of guiding [conventions](./conventions.md).

Detailed documentation for the engine's API can be found
[here](./engine_api.md).
